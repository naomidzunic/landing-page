# landing-page

Ok this is the first landing page, simple website, whatever you want to call it. 

This is truly testing HTMl, and more importantly CSS. 

Don't be afraid to Google things to make things easier for you. 

And be sure to commit your things to Git too. 

Now that things are done here are some things to continue working on: 

Alignment - Whether that's an image with next on the side or the navigation bar. We want to make sure everything looks cohesive and in alignment. Nevertheless well done on creating the landingpage. As mentioned the nav bar and the hero could use some work with some alignment as well as the pricing/options part but it's not terrible and that will come with more practice later down the road. 

Boxes & Containers - This can get confusing espeically when you're trying to style a specific item. This will also come with more practice as we go but well done on the CTA section. 


All in all it's not terrible for a first landing page. With more practice there's plenty of room to easily improve in these areas as well as refractoring the code so that it's much easier to read.
